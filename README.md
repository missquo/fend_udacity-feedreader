## Introduction

The object of this project is to learn the value of testing code, and provides an initial feed reader application against which the student must write tests to verify that feed entries are being populated correctly, and whether the page's menu is operating correctly.

## Dependencies

This project uses a feed reader application from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), as well the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework.

## Verifying Tests Have Passed

By opening the index.html file in a browser, the user can see the results of all the tests that have been written in the Jasmine display at the bottom of the page.

## Try It Yourself

The starting code provided by Udacity is available on their [GitHub Repository](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader), and already has Jasmine included.
